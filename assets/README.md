# Assets

Place your birthday cake 3D model at `assets/cake.glb`. The page will load this file automatically. If no model is present, a simple 3D cake placeholder built with basic shapes will be shown instead.

Optional: add your own background music at `assets/birthday-melody.wav`. If the file is absent, the page will quietly run without audio.
